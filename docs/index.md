# Introduction

During the 2013-2015 Lunarc has been operating a desktop infrastructure on the Alarik resource, to evaluate if this could complement the existing terminal-based environment. This environment have been continously been in production since mid 2013 and been a great success among the users. We currently have approximately between 30-50 active users in this environment.

A prototype system was procured to test and develop ideas for a more rich and scalable SNIC desktop architecture. The prototype was installed in the beginning of 2015 and will be the blueprint for the upcoming Aurora desktop infrastructure.
